//Creating local repository
1. git init - initialize git
2. git add + file name = git status of file
3. git commit -m + "Message" - commit change
//Always write in present tense

//Syncing with remote repository
1. Create the repository on GitHub - obtain the remote
2. git remote add origin + URL provided
3. git push -u origin master
// origin is the master of the remote and we're pushing it to master, the name of the branch. Master branch is the default branch.

//To remove all from staging area
git rm --cached -r .


git status - view staging area
git log - see all commits
git add . - add everything in the directory
git diff + file name - see difference in changes
git checkout + file - roll back file to last state/checkpoint


//gitignore
//to create hidden file
1. touch .gitignore
2. open the file
3. add each file we don't want uploaded on a new line exactly how it is spelled
"#" is equal to a comment - "//"
"*.txt" (or file type) also works

//Can go to gitignore on github.com for a swift template full of file types and extensions I can add to a projects gitingore file. Quite literally, copy and paste the entire list.
